* Phase Transformation (Pre MSem) and Heat Treatment (Post MSem)
* Definition of diff Mechanical Properties:
  1. Strength: or tensile strength: max strength againt outside force (stress) borne by materials, given by tensile test.
  2. Ductility: Ability to deform before breaking; against **brittleness**. Gives %elongation
  3. Toughness: Ability to absorb energy. Strong temperature dependance
  4. Fatigue Resistence: Resistance of a material under fluctuating load
  5. Creep: Time-varying plastic deformation of a material stressed at high temperatures. Examples: turbine blades, steam generators.
  >> Strength measures the resistance of a material to failure, given by the applied stress. Toughness measures the energy required to crack a material. 
  
  All 5 properties will depend on **microstructure properties**:
    * No Phases & Grain Size
* Heat Treatment => (Phase Transformation), Microstructure => Properties

### Phase & Transformation
* Phase(?):
  * In same state, we can have two phases. (State != Phase)
* Transformation (why & when?):
